Hey there!  Kevin here.

The response to 757DevCon has been amazing.  If you've passed the word to others in your community, thank you!  If not, why not!?  Send the address, http://757devcon.com, to ONE person and ask them to register.  I'd personally appreciate it.

I've been developing software professionally for almost 8 years.  Some of those years were for a major corporation, some for a local consultancy, and the last few have been working for myself [Hint hint - I'm always looking for more work].  I've worked with a variety of languages and frameworks ranging from C++ to JavaScript.  It has always been fun for me to learn new stuff and keep my skills close to the cutting edge.

I would really love to learn more about the type of developer you are, and more importantly: the type of developer you WANT to be.  Your day job might be slinging code on an AS-400, but you yearn for the chance to hack together an angular.js app running on node.js and hosted on AWS.  I know... you laugh.  For a lot of developers, this is reality.

Tell me more about yourself.  Feel free to hit reply, the email will find it's way to me.
Where you do work now?  For yourself?  For a big company?  If you don't want share, that's perfectly fine.
What's your stack look like?  Are you heads down in Ruby or Python? Is your data stored in MongoDB?  What tech are you actually working with?
If you could change your stack, what would it be?  Heck, is there something you've wanted to dabble with but haven't had the opportunity?
Thanks again for your support!
